## Introduction

PSVWR (Pan-genome Structural Variants Walker) is a tool that is still under development. It attempts to perform genotyping of SVs in sample based on the third-generation sequencing alignment result and complex graph pan-genome (including SNPs, indels, SVs, etc.).

Limitation:
- At present, the genotyping results are not satisfactory and further improvements are needed.
- Cannot detect noval SVs now.

## Dependencies

- Python >= 3.7
- networkx >= 3.4.2
- gfatools >= 0.5

## Quick Start

```bash
python genotyper.py -i XX.gaf -g XX.gfa -o output_directory -ot 1/2 -t threads
```
- GAF file: Currently, only GAF files generated by GraphAligner are supported.
- GFA file: The GFA file must be in rGFA format, which includes required tag such as SN, SO, and SR at least for segments from reference genome.
- For argument "ot", 1 means outputing one SV per bubble, 2 means outputing several SVs per bubble.
